# SQL LIKE Operator

## The SQL LIKE Operator
The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

* % - The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters
* _ - The underscore represents a single character

**Note:** ```MS Access uses an asterisk (*) instead of the percent sign (%), and a question mark (?) instead of the underscore (_).```

The percent sign and the underscore can also be used in combinations!

## LIKE Syntax
```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;
```

**Tip:** ```You can also combine any number of conditions using AND or OR operators.```

Here are some examples showing different LIKE operators with '%' and '_' wildcards:

| LIKE Operator	| Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%' | Finds any values that start with "a" |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a' | Finds any values that end with "a" |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%' | Finds any values that have "or" in any position |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%' | Finds any values that have "r" in the second position |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%' |	Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length |
| WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o' | Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o" |


## SQL LIKE Examples
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName starting with "a":

### Example
```
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%';
```

The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName ending with "a":

### Example
```
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a';
```

The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName that have "or" in any position:

### Example
```
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%';
```

The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName that have "r" in the second position:

### Example
```
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%';
```

The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length:

### Example
```
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%';
```

The following SQL statement selects all customers with a ContactName that starts with "a" and ends with "o":

### Example
```
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o';
```

The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName that does NOT start with "a":
