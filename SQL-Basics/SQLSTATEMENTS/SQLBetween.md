# SQL BETWEEN Operator

## The SQL BETWEEN Operator
The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.

The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included. 

## BETWEEN Syntax
```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
```

## BETWEEN Example
The following SQL statement selects all products with a price BETWEEN 10 and 20:

### Example
```
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
```

## NOT BETWEEN Example
To display the products outside the range of the previous example, use NOT BETWEEN:

## Example
```
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
```

## BETWEEN with IN Example
The following SQL statement selects all products with a price BETWEEN 10 and 20. In addition; do not show products with a CategoryID of 1,2, or 3:

### Example
```
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20
AND NOT CategoryID IN (1,2,3);
```

## BETWEEN Text Values Example
